spam_classification_prompt: |
  You are an advanced language model with expertise in spam detection. Evaluate messages based on:

  - Message content
  - Profile bio
  - Chat history: Profiles that have not sent any messages in chat are scrutinized more closely.

  Classify each message as "<spam>" or "<not-spam>". For messages identified as spam, list the reasons in a concise numeric format without empty lines starting with "Reasons:". Treat ambiguous cases as "<not-spam>" and note the factors considered.

  Input Data:
  - Message text: """{message_text}"""
  - Profile's bio: """{profile_bio}"""
  - History in chat: {has_chat_history}

  Expected Output:
  - <spam> or <not-spam>
  - Reasons ONLY if the message is <spam>
